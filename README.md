# LabVIEW MIDI Tool
A development Tool for MIDI, using UART via USB. This project were intended for [this](https://github.com/BLE-MIDI/NCS-MIDI) BLE-MIDI Project. It's main focus was checking how the MIDI data was parsed.

It is overly advanced as I was testing out, and learning about, producer/consumer design. As well as adding some template elements for myself.

# Disclaimer
It has been a while since last use, and I would therefore advice that anyone attempting to use this should do a thorough examination of this repository. Before running it at their own risk!

This project is no longer active, as it served it's use. Unless a massive interest arises... However I'll be happy to answer any questions, check my profile for contact information.

# Bugs and improvements
- If the program crashes, a full reboot of the computer may be necessary to gain full functionality again.
- Adding support for other communication plattforms.
- Simplify the whole thing.
- Organize the files better.
